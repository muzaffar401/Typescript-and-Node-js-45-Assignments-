//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color 
//and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

//• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

//part 1
// let alien_color = "yellow";

// if(alien_color == "yellow")
// console.log("You earn 5 Points");

//part 2
let alien_color = "red";

if(alien_color == "green")
console.log("No Output");
